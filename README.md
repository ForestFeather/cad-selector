## Inspiration
Much thanks to Bryce O'Connor and Luke Chmilenko for the absolute wonderful book Warformed:  The Iron Prince.  It's been a nonstop audio and written companion for me, and a source of many thoughts of creative endeavors.

## Planned Improvements
Several improvements are planned and/or in the works, including:
- Seeding the generator to get the same results each time
- Ability to copy results into a friendly format for sharing with others
- Ability to set a generator CAD level or other parameters
- Add different name generation sources (language and culture based) or type your own
- Visual CAD display with changing band colors
- Test score results from written and physical exam
- MIND notes
- Ability generator
- More?
